    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This sweet potato burrito recipe is a little different, but I've had many, many requests for it. Once you've had one, you'll want another. Serve these with sour cream, chopped green onions, and salsa.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups canned kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons prepared mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups mashed cooked sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium skillet. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is soft.</li>
        <li>Mash beans into onion mixture. Gradually stir in water; heat until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce, chili powder, mustard, cumin, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Divide bean mixture and mashed sweet potatoes evenly between warm tortillas; top with cheese.</li>
        <li>Fold tortillas, burrito-style, around fillings and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
